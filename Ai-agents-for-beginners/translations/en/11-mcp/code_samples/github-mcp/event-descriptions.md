## Event Name: Multi-Agent API with LangGraph and Azure Cosmos DB

## Description

Multi-agent AI applications are changing how we build intelligent systemsâ€”but how do you design them for real-world scalability and performance? In this session, weâ€™ll dive into a production-ready multi-agent app built with LangGraph for agent orchestration, FastAPI for the API layer, and Azure Cosmos DB for state management, vector storage, and transactional data.

Through a detailed code walkthrough, youâ€™ll learn how to design and implement an agent-driven workflow that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory persistence, and dynamic state transitions. Topics include:

- Agent collaboration with LangGraph for structured reasoning  
- Real-time chat history storage using Azure Cosmos DBâ€”the same database behind ChatGPTâ€™s chat history, the fastest-growing AI agent app ever  
- Vector search for knowledge retrieval with Cosmos DBâ€™s native embeddings support  
- FastAPIâ€™s async features to keep interactions responsive and scalable  

By the end, youâ€™ll have a clear blueprint for building and deploying scalable, cloud-native multi-agent applications that leverage modern AI and cloud infrastructure. Whether youâ€™re an AI engineer, cloud architect, or Python developer, this talk offers practical insights and proven patterns to build the next generation of AI-powered apps.

## Event Name: Prompting is the New Scripting: Meet GenAIScript

## Description

jQuery once made web development easier by hiding complexities, letting developers focus on building instead of browser quirks. Today, AI development faces a similar challenge. New patterns emerge constantly, and keeping up can be overwhelmingâ€”especially as AI tools, particularly agentic ones, become more powerful and complex.  
What if you could use cutting-edge AI capabilities to automate tasks with simple, familiar JavaScript abstractions? Enter GenAIScriptâ€”a way to seamlessly integrate AI into your workflow by treating prompts like reusable code snippets. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore how GenAIScript makes AI automation agents feel as natural as writing JavaScript, helping you streamline repetitive tasks without needing deep AI expertise.
