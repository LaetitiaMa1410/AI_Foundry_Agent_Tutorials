    "# Plan and Execute Pattern using Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Plan and Execute pattern using Semantic Kernel. This pattern improves agent performance by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Breaking down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks (Planning)\n",
    "2. Executing each sub-task in sequence\n",
    "3. Adapting to feedback during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern involves:\n",
    "- **Planner**: Responsible for generating a structured plan of sub-tasks\n",
    "- **Executor**: Handles the execution of each sub-task\n",
    "- **Memory**: Maintains context between steps\n",
    "- **Tools**: Custom functions that can be called during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "![Plan and Execute Pattern](../../../1_agentic-design-ptn/images/planning.png)"

    "## Understanding the Plan and Execute Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern we've demonstrated offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks are broken down into simpler, manageable steps\n",
    "2. **Tool Selection**: The planner automatically selects the appropriate tools for each step\n",
    "3. **Adaptability**: If a step fails, the planner can adapt by trying alternative approaches\n",
    "4. **Explainability**: The plan provides transparency into how the agent approaches problems\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly useful for tasks that require multiple steps or the use of various tools to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern can be applied to various real-world scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Helping customers troubleshoot complex issues step by step\n",
    "- **Research Assistance**: Breaking down research questions into specific search queries and synthesis steps\n",
    "- **Task Automation**: Creating workflows that combine multiple API calls and data transformations\n",
    "- **Product Recommendations**: Gathering user preferences and matching them to suitable products\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend this pattern, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding error handling to retry failed steps\n",
    "2. Implementing dynamic replanning based on execution results\n",
    "3. Incorporating user feedback between steps\n",
    "4. Adding more specialized tools for specific domains"

      "To compare a Samsung laptop and a Samsung tablet for schoolwork and movie watching, let's outline the common features and considerations for each option.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Samsung Laptop\n",
      "1. **Performance**:\n",
      "   - Typically equipped with larger processors (Intel or AMD Ryzen), which are better for multitasking and running more demanding applications often required for schoolwork.\n",
      "   - More RAM options (usually starting from 8GB upwards) which aids in speed and performance, especially for running multiple applications simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Software**:\n",
      "   - Runs Windows, which is compatible with a wider range of software, especially academic programs such as Microsoft Office, statistical software, programming environments, etc.\n",
      "   - More storage options, with HDD and SSD choices, allowing for larger file storage (important for coursework).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Display**:\n",
      "   - Generally features a larger screen (13-17 inches) providing a better viewing experience for movies, presentations, and multitasking (split-screen).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Keyboard and Touchpad**:\n",
      "   - Built-in keyboard provides a more comfortable typing experience, which is beneficial for long study sessions and homework.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ports and Connectivity**:\n",
      "   - More USB ports, HDMI, and possibly Ethernet options for better connectivity with other devices or networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Samsung Tablet\n",
      "1. **Portability**:\n",
      "   - Lightweight and highly portable, making it easy to carry around for classes, studying or watching movies on the go.\n",
      "   - Longer battery life compared to laptops, which is beneficial for extended use without a charger.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Touchscreen and Flexibility**:\n",
      "   - Varies from standalone devices to 2-in-1 models (like Galaxy Tab S series), which can also function like laptops with a keyboard attachment.\n",
      "   - Touchscreen functionality is user-friendly for casual browsing and watching movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **App Availability**:\n",
      "   - Runs on Android OS, which has a rich library of educational and entertainment apps. However, productivity apps may be more limited compared to desktop versions.\n",
      "   - Samsung DeX mode enables a desktop-like experience, allowing for multitasking and using apps side by side.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Display Quality**:\n",
      "   - High-resolution screens (especially in the Galaxy Tab S series) provide vibrant visuals for movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Price Point**:\n",
      "   - Generally more affordable than laptops, but the performance for extensive schoolwork may not match that of a laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "- **For schoolwork**: A Samsung Laptop is likely more suitable as it has the processing power and software compatibility needed for academic tasks, along with a comfortable typing experience.\n",
      "- **For watching movies and portability**: A Samsung Tablet excels due to its lightweight design, battery life, and vibrant display, making it great for entertainment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the best choice will depend on your priorities: if the focus is on productivity and school, go for the laptop; if you value portability and casual viewing, consider the tablet. If possible, a combination of both might serve all needs effectively.\n"
